# @holman tweets

This is an archive of most of the tweets I've made from
[@holman](http://twitter.com/holman).

It isn't all of my tweets, though. Twitter's API limits mean you can only get
3200 tweets back at a maximum, anytime, ever. So once you've gone past that
3200th tweet, you can never ever see that tweet again, either via
twitter.com or via any other third-party service.

The reason Twitter does this is mostly because **Twitter does not give a fuck
about your data**. That's unfortunate. [I wrote about this a year ago](http://zachholman.com/2010/09/hey-twitter-give-us-our-tweets/),
although nothing has changed since then. Admittedly, it could be because Twitter
doesn't give a fuck about your data, but it also could be because they couldn't
ship themselves out of a UPS store, much less ship any interesting product in
the last year.
